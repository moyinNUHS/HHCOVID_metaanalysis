BUT “One hundred and seventy three of 1,111 participants reported ILI on their baseline survey. The remaining 938 subjects were considered ILI-free and analyzed for incident ILI during the study period. For incident ILI, an ILI-free study population at baseline was examined (N = 938/1,111). For”

[consider only looking at  outcomes available when intervention was in place within  48 hours of index case ]


Questions: 

1) how were the 938 considered at risk of ILI distributed into the three groups?
2) why does hand hygiene use reported in text differ from log-transformed using Table 1? (maybe because

3. Larson

Follow up time: 19 months but mean duration of the households in the study was 55.5 weeks
Clusters recruited through index cases?   No
One or multiple outcomes per individual: multiple (outcomes both for URI and ILI; URI reported here)
number of arms:  3
Cluster of individual level outcomes: 

*No. of units per arm (randomised households)

Control: 46526

*Hand sanitzer events per day

“Members of the Hand Sanitizer group used a mean of 12.1 ounces/month and the Hand Sanitizer and Face Mask group used a mean of 11.6 ounces/month (including counted empty bottles and self-reports) (p50.36). At the exit survey, 44.2% (65/147) of households from the Education group reported using hand sanitizer occasionally at some point during the study, and 56.9% of these (37/65) reported using hand sanitizer one to two times within the previous 24 hours.”

WILL HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT BASELINE HAND WASHING RATE BASED ON OTHER STUDIES AS NO DATA REPORTED

*Hand washing events per day
Control:

Mask + hand hygiene: 

*Mask hours per day:

“Although households were instructed about mask use, and reinforcement by the RA and Project Manager occurred frequently, only half (22/44) of the households with an ILI reported using masks within 48 hours of episode onset. Those who used masks at all reported a mean of only two masks/ day/ILI episode (range: 0–9). “
SO WILL NEED TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MASK USE AS WELL TO USE THIS ARM

4. Nicholson

Follow up time: 41 weeks
Clusters recruited through index cases?  No
One or multiple outcomes per individual:  Multiple
number of arms: 2
Cluster of individual level outcomes:  individual level
Questions:  ARI rates suggest about 4 ARIs per person per year (table 3). Seems high. Is it plausible?

Notes: “This was a cluster randomised controlled study with one community in each of 35 matched pairs randomly allocated to intervention and one to control. “
*No. of communities per arm
Control: 35
Hand hygiene: 35

*No. of households per arm
Control: 833
Hand hygiene: 847

*Outcomes ARI cases (not directly reported but calculated form rates in Table 3 for whole family and reported person weeks based on assumptions below)
Control: 20526 
Hand hygiene: 18432


Assumptions:
 in control arm there were 267.8*4812/7 =184093 person weeks
 in hand hygiene arm there were 268*4863/7 = 186183 person weeks

*Denominators  - individuals (analysed data based on table 1))
Control: 4812
Hand hygiene: 4863

Also “mean number of observation days per subject: hand hygiene = 268.0 days, control = 267.8 days.

*Hand sanitzer events per day (none - soap and water only)
Control:  assume 0
Hand hygiene:  assume 0

*Hand washing events per day

WILL HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS based on data below and household size. 

“We estimated the med- ian soap consumption to be 45 g per household per week in control households compared with 235 g in intervention households.

5. Suess

Follow up time: x weeks
Clusters recruited through index cases?  yes. 
One or multiple outcomes per individual: 
number of arms: 3
Cluster of individual level outcomes: 
Questions:
Notes: additional data reported for households where intervention was implemented within 36 h after symptom onset of the index case.
(MH) arm: households were provided with alcohol based hand-rub 

*No. of units per arm
Control: 30
Mask only: 26 
Mask + hand hygiene:  28

*Outcomes ILI cases
Control: 14
Mask only: 6
Mask + hand hygiene: 6

*Denominators  (household contacts)
Control: 82
Mask only: 69
Mask + hand hygiene: 67

Some data but  WILL HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS to quantify hand hygiene changes

*Hand sanitzer events per day
Control:  NA
Mask:  NA
Mask + hand hygiene:  8.8 in 2009/2010 and 7.5 in 2011 for contacts, 7.4 and 4.1  for index cases (take average…or separate analysis by year (but then ILI outcomes are not reported by year)

The mean amount of alcohol based hand rub used over the study period by individuals in the MH group was higher in 2009/10 compared to 2010/11 (85.2 ml vs. 42.7 ml, p = 0.2). 

Note that figure 4 does give hand hygiene data before intervention (green lines) - giving values of 0-2 per day. Should be able to make assumptions based on this. 

*Hand washing events per day
Control: NA
Mask: NA
Mask + hand hygiene: NA

*Mask hours per day:

Only in 2010/11 did we assess the mean number of facemasks used per day and individual: participants in the M group used a mean number of 1.8 (SD: 1.8) and those in the MH group 1.7 (SD: 2.0) facemasks per day. 
Figs 2 and 3 show daily proportion and 95% confidence interval of household contacts wearing a facemask ‘always’ or ‘mostly’ in transmission-prone situations, i

6. Pandejpong

Follow up time: 12 weeks
Clusters recruited through index cases?   No
One or multiple outcomes per individual: multiple
number of arms: 3 (hand hygiene before lunch, every 120 minutes, and every 60 minutes)
Cluster of individual level outcomes:  individual
Questions:
Notes: alcohol hand gel intervention only. Hand hygiene not reported but given it was directly observed and teachers signed for perhaps reasonable to assume it was according to protocol: “To ensure the compliance of each intervention group, 2 research assistants were assigned to monitor the use of alcohol hand gel every 60 or 120 minutes for the duration of the 12-week study. Classroom teachers were required to cosign after each disinfection round.” Perhaps 6 times per day in hourly arm, 3 times in 2 hourly, and once in control.

Outcomes reported as rates of absenteeism due to confirmed ILI. ILI episodes not reported, but from Figure 2 	we should be able to approximately extract number of ILI episodes in each arm
