Notes on stan runs

metareg.stan is fine when includding studies 3,4,5,6. 

Adding trial one to this gives convergence problems.

Adding trial two to this also gives convergence problems. 



Suggest to me 


Solution:

Consdier allowing for random effects in slope terms to account for variation between arms
Also consider allowing ror overispersion
